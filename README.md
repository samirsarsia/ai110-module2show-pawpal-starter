# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Below is the actual terminal output from running the demo script (`python main.py`).
It builds an owner (Jordan) with two pets (Mochi the dog, Whiskers the cat) and
five care tasks, then prints the generated daily plan — evidence the system runs
correctly:

```
====================================================
  Today's Schedule for Jordan
  Time budget: 90 min | starts 08:00
====================================================
  1. 08:00–08:05  Feed cat (Whiskers) [high, 5 min]
       ↳ high-priority task; fit within the remaining 90 min of budget
  2. 08:05–08:15  Feed dog (Mochi) [high, 10 min]
       ↳ high-priority task; fit within the remaining 85 min of budget
  3. 08:15–08:45  Morning walk (Mochi) [high, 30 min]
       ↳ high-priority task; fit within the remaining 75 min of budget
  4. 08:45–09:10  Grooming (Mochi) [medium, 25 min]
       ↳ medium-priority task; fit within the remaining 45 min of budget
  5. 09:10–09:30  Play / enrichment (Whiskers) [low, 20 min]
       ↳ low-priority task; fit within the remaining 20 min of budget
----------------------------------------------------
  5 tasks scheduled, 90 min total.
====================================================
```

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | | e.g., by priority, duration |
| Filtering | | e.g., skip tasks if time runs out |
| Conflict handling | | e.g., overlapping time slots |
| Recurring tasks | | e.g., daily vs. weekly |
